				<div class="sec_title">Undergraduate Research Showcase</div>
				<b>Duffield Atrium</b>
				<div class="par">
					Through undergraduate research opportunities Cornell Engineering students experience the exciting process of discovery and innovation. Almost half of our undergraduates participate in some form of research here in the college and through our affiliations with other institutions across the country and internationally.  Guided by faculty mentors, students apply classroom learning to improve existing processes or to develop entirely new approaches.
