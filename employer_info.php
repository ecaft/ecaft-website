	There are two entrances to the Barton Hall (the Career Fair location). One side is for students 
	(the Statler side) and the other side is for recruiters (Teagle side); there will be signs around 
	the Cornell campus which will direct you to the correct entrance. Hotel shuttles (if available) 
	have already been instructed to drop you off at the Teagle entrance. When you check-in to your 
	hotels, please notify them that you will be requiring shuttle service and arrange a time to go 
	to the career fair.
	</div>
	<div class="par">
	If you are driving from your hotel to the career fair, please note that you can drop off any packages 
	you have at the Teagle entrance and then drive to a parking garage 
	(<a class="link" href="employer_info.php#parking">parking information</a>). 
	When you check-in, you will be led to your table and will have to fill out a 
	form which a volunteer will later pick up.
	</div>
	<div class="last_par">
	If you are sending several recruiters to the event we highly advise that you ask them to wear name-tags 
	stating which department they are from (for example, the BEE division or MechE division). This will save 
	both your time and the students' time. In past career fairs we've had several students wait in line 
	only to realize that they were waiting to speak to the wrong representative.
