						<p>The Cornell Engineering Career Fair Team welcomes you to Cornell! We hope you find your visit enjoyable. Please feel free to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:ecaft@cornell.edu">ecaft@cornell.edu</a> if you have any questions.</p>

						<p>There are two entrances to the Barton Hall (the Career Fair location). One side is for students (the Statler side) and the other side is for recruiters (Teagle side); there will be signs around the Cornell campus which will direct you to the correct entrance. Hotel shuttles (if available) have already been instructed to drop you off at the Teagle entrance. When you check-in to your hotels, please notify them that you will be requiring shuttle service and arrange a time to go to the career fair.</p>
						<p>If you are driving from your hotel to the career fair, please note that you can drop off any packages you have at the Teagle entrance and then drive to a parking garage (<a href="https://ipp.cornell.edu/content/parking-0">parking information</a>). When you check-in, you will be led to your table and will have to fill out a form which a volunteer will later pick up.</p>
						<p>If you are sending several recruiters to the event we highly advise that you ask them to wear name-tags stating which department they are from (for example, the BEE division or MechE division). This will save both your time and the students' time. In past career fairs we've had several students wait in line only to realize that they were waiting to speak to the wrong representative.</p>
